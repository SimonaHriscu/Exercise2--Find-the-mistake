**2. Find the mistake.**

Given what is supposed to be typed and what is actually typed, write a function that returns the broken key(s). 
The function looks like:
findBrokenKeys(correct phrase, what you actually typed)

* Notes
Broken keys should be ordered by when they first appear in the sentence.
Only one broken key per letter should be listed.
Letters will all be in lower case.

* Examples
findBrokenKeys("happy birthday", "hawwy birthday") ➞ ["p"]
findBrokenKeys("starry night", "starrq light") ➞ ["y", "n"]
findBrokenKeys("beethoven", "affthoif5") ➞ ["b", "e", "v", "n"]
